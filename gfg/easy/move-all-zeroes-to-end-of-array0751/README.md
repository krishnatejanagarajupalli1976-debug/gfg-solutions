# Move All Zeroes to End

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given an array **arr[]** of non-negative integers, move all the zeros to the end of the array while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements. Perform the operation in place, without using an extra array.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 0, 4, 3, 0, 5, 0]
Output: [1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0]
Explanation: The three zeros are moved to the end while the order of the non-zero elements remains unchanged.

```

```
Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 30]
Output: [10, 20, 30]
Explanation: No change in array as there are no 0s.

```

```
Input: arr[] = [0, 0]
Output: [0, 0]
Explanation: No change in array as there are all 0s.
```

```java
class Solution {
    void pushZerosToEnd(int[] arr) {
        // code here
        int count=0;
        int j=0;
        for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++)
        {
            if(arr[i]!=0)
            {
                arr[j]=arr[i];
                j++;
            }
            else
            {
                count++;
            }
        }
        while(count!=0)
        {
            arr[j]=0;
            j++;
            count--;
        }
    
    }
}
```
